                Message from the Secretary General
            </h1>


            <p class="flow-text">Hello, <br>
              As we get ready to usher in the New Year with great fanfare and

              celebration, it is natural that we look forward to 2017 being the harbinger

              of a new phase of success, prosperity and well-being in our lives. In the

              same vein, a group of young and vibrant CETians takes great honour to

              be a part of an endeavour that you are sure to cherish- CET MUN 2017.

              Being one of the oldest MUNs in Odisha whose first edition was

              organised way back in 2013, CET MUN pioneered the healthy culture of

              MUNs in this circuit. Now, its back in full vigour and in a brand new

              Avatar. Spread over three days of stimulating discussions and dialogue,

              the three committees being simulated in this edition are sure to define

              constructive diplomacy. It is our abiding commitment to ensure quality of

              debate and provide a grand platform to over 250 delegates to articulate

              themselves and prove their skills. Our Secretariat constantly strives to

              offer a memorable experience- be it within the council or outside it. The

              council proceedings apart, the Delegates should look forward to multiple

              social nights with the star night sure to take everybody&#39;s breath away!

              Too much revelation for now! As the conference approaches, we would

              be giving you a thousand reasons to honour us and enrich yourselves

              with your presence. Once again, a Hearty Welcome to CET MUN 2017.

              We just can&#39;t wait to have you here soon!            </p>

            <p class="flow-text">
Â I look forward to seeing you all in January.
            </p>
