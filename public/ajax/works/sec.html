                Dear Citizens of the world,
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
                On behalf of the secretariat, organizing committee and staff, it gives me great pleasure in welcoming you to Ravenshaw University Model United Nations 2016, which will be held from the 8th -10th of July, 2016 at Ravenshaw University, Cuttack.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
 The conference has been structured with four committees and the International Press, and our belief is that each committee offers something new and unprecedented in the Indian MUN Circuit. Our aim is to encourage the participants to think even after the three days of debate, so that ideas and thoughts do not remain in the four walls of the councils. We believe that we will be truly successful, when each and every participant at the MUN goes back, still thinking, with a different view on a global issue, and a desire to make a difference.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">

            <p class="flow-text">
